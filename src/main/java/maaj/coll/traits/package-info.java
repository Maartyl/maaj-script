 * This package traits* for collections and other container types (/terms generally, but not necessarily).<br/>
 * * A trait is understood as part of a collection of some properties and functionality.
 * These are implemented as interfaces, so they can be combined into creating more precise and capable concepts.
 * They can contain default methods, if these can be defined in just terms of the other "properties".
